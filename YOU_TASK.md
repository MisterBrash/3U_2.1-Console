📝 Your Tasks:
(Read carefully and work with a partner if you are struggling - ask Mr. Brash only after asking a classmate)

- Open VSCode.
- Go to FILE > Close Folder (if that option exists)
- Go to FILE > Open Folder
  - Create a new folder called "Unit 1" and select that
- Add a new file to VSCode
  - Name the new file "1.1 - Output.js"

Now try the following coding tasks and "run" your code to test the output:

#### 1. Add the appropriate code(s) to the JavaScript file `1.1 - Output.js` that will print the address for Apple Inc.:
>Apple Inc.<br>One Apple Park Way<br>Cupertino, CA<br>95014<br>+1 408-996-1010

#### 2. Output two blank lines (to separate task 1 and 3)

#### 3. Now print the following with only a SINGLE `console.log( )` command:
>Microsoft Corporation<br>One Microsoft Way<br>Redmond, WA<br>98052<br>+1 425-882-8080

#### 4. Output two blank lines (to separate task 3 and 5)

#### 5. Finally, output the following to the console using _one_ `console.log( )` command with horizontal tabs between the letters:
```
x  o  x
o  x  o
x  o  x
```

When you are sure that you've followed the instructions _perfectly_, ask Mr. Brash to check your work.
